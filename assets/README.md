# Site Assets

Add marketing photography and other static files referenced by `index` here. The build only expects filenames listed in the HTML (for example `detail-door-trim.jpg`), so drop your optimized JPG/PNG assets into this folder when you are ready to launch.

The repository keeps this placeholder file so the directory exists in a fresh clone and the IDE setup step that requires an `assets/` workspace folder succeeds.
